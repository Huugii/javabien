I've been using WordPress for a small week now. My impressions?

 + It's no very fast. It could be my provider not being fast enough so I'll have to install it on my server to make sure.
 + It seems difficult to write JAVA code extracts. I get additional `<p>` tags in the middle of my code.
 + I need an offline way of writing articles with proper visualization based on the same rendering engine

Any ideas ?
