Managed to speed up the site using the <a href="http://photomatt.net/2004/07/26/staticize-25/">Staticize</a> plug'in. It keeps a static version of each article until a new article is added. A different static page is stored for each different user (recognized by a cookie).

Also managed to display neat code extracts using another plug'in: <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/10/10533">iG:Syntax Hiliter</a>.
