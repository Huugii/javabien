Today, I upgraded to Wordpress 1.5. I have to say that the changes this version brings are welcome.

 + The CSS support is a must have for any modern blog
 + Coming with CSS support, the new default style is way better than the old one
 + They iG:Syntax Hiliter plugin works well now. They fixed the problem with pre tag

Also, the upgrade from v1.4 is a one step process. Have a try!
