You own a <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/">mac </a>and use <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> every day? Why don't you <a href="http://labs.google.com/googlex/">GoogleX</a>?

Once again Google demonstrates that great things can still be done on web client.

<em>As of yesterday, Google removed its GoogleX page. However, it can be found elsewhere. <a href="http://googlex.iamcannabian.com/">This site</a> gives you a zip file containing the files to keep the page alive. <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Mac OS X</a> rocks !</em>
