In my previous post [Open Source JAVA : Step by step]({{< relref "2005/03/18/open-source-step-by-step.md" >}}), I said there should be a unique and simple way to submit bug fixes to Sun's JDK. I was assuming that the only way was to go through the <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/index.jsp">Bug Parade</a>.

In fact, with JDK 6.0, the way to send a bug fix is to go to <a href="https://jdk-collaboration.dev.java.net/contributions/index.html">JDK Contributions</a>. On this site, Sun let's us submit fixes that are outside of the scope of the JCP.

This picture taken from <a href="http://www.java.net/">java.net</a> site shows with transparency how the JDK team will react to any submission : <img src="https://jdk-collaboration.dev.java.net/contributions/images/process.png" alt="how bug fix submissions are processed" />

This is the kind of move that will make JAVA more open sourced.
