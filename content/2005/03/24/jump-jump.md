No JAVA related article today.

I've found this <a href="http://www.worldjumpday.org/">site</a> wandering on the web yesterday. People there want to have 600.000 people jump at the same time to change Earth's orbit and climate...

Isn't it some kind of hidden plot to <a href="http://ned.ucam.org/~sdh31/misc/destroy.html#methods">destroy our beloved Earth</a>? :-)
