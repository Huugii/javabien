In the integration world, the buzz is around ESB. One of the reasons might be the increasing availability of good quality Open Source products. My current favorite is <a href="http://mule.codehaus.org/">Mule</a> because it does what I need. The most interesting challenger might be <a href="http://servicemix.org/">Service Mix</a>. Because it's based on JBI, it is more powerful. The project one should keep an eye on is <a href="https://open-esb.dev.java.net/">OpenESB</a>. Sun's coming on the playground is a good thing.
