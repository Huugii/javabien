<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX">AJAX</a> is everywhere ! You can go to almost any web site, it is using AJAX or talking about AJAX. Why ? Because we can now have on the web things like <a href="http://script.aculo.us/demos/shop">drag&drop</a>, <a href="http://script.aculo.us/">on-the-fly form validation</a>, <a href="http://script.aculo.us/demos/ajax/autocompleter_customized">auto-completion</a>, <a href="http://script.aculo.us/demos/ajax/sortable_elements">list reordering</a>, ... Great ! But wait a minute... Is it really new ? Well... not really. In fact any "fat client" application have these. You see, this is the thing : we have no more limit on our "thin client" applications !

<strong>OK. But what about Look&Feel ?</strong> JAVA Swing's biggest complain is that it doesn't have the look and feel of the Windows application users are used to. Can you see a common Look&Feel emerging for AJAX enabled sites ? I don't. We talk a lot about Web 2.0. Will it come with a standard L&F ? In that case, what will it look like ? MacOSX Aqua, Windows Vista, Linux Kde or (Add you own) ? The fact that even Google doesn't manage to apply a common L&F to all its web applications makes me a little pessimistic. The web looks like an old Amiga : nice colors everywhere, no common direction for GUIs. Seems like it's always the same story we play again and again. (ps: think also about accessibility)
