JSR260 tries to answer this question : <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/aim/archive/2006/01/invitation_to_w.html">Should Javadoc evolve</a> ?

I personally almost never use Javadoc since I use Eclipse and jump directly to the code.

One way improve would be to use <a href="http://getahead.ltd.uk/doctree/">Ajax to replace the old frame template</a>. It would add search capabilities with auto completion. But Google does it for us already...
