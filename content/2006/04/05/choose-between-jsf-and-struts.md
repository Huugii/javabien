Take a look at <a title="jobtrends" target="_blank" href="http://www.indeed.com/jobtrends">jobtrends</a> for job offers in the US on <a title="indeed" target="_blank" href="http://www.indeed.com">indeed.com</a>. Interesting enough to see that there are 10x more offers for Struts than JSF.

Also interesting to see that the number of JSF offers doubled in the last 12 months.
