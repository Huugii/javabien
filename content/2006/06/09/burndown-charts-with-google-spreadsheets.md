Google just launched <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/">Google Spreadsheets</a>. It is minimal spreadsheeting but still is groovy.

<strong>Just one question</strong>: when do they plan to add charting so that I can track Scrum Product and Iteration backlogs and display Burndown Charts?

Nice play Google, keep on changing our digital world.
