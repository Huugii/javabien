In a [previous post]({{< relref "2006/01/28/should-javadoc-evolve.md" >}}), I wondered if JavaDoc should evolve to replace the standard/framed/plain HTML/sober JavaDoc by something more sexy/responsive/Ajax. This is what the <a href="http://www.docwrench.com/">DocWrench</a> project is trying to achieve.

 + Tabbed view,
 + "Google Suggest like" search field,
 + Responsive interface,
 + Not yet sexy however.
