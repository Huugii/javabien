Here are a few little improvements I like in Leopard:

 + Using Spotlight as an application launcher is easier than before because Apple decreased the response times for showing Applications that match the search criteria
 + Print preview in now embedded in most Print dialog. Nice !
 + The Airport menu is much more responsive and shows an indicator for open/close networks

*Update:*

 + Subversion is standard
 + Maven 2 too
