After reading <a href="http://scrum.aubryconseil.com/">Claude Aubry's Blog</a>, I wanted to check <a href="http://www.nerdtests.com/ft_nq.php">how much Nerd</a> I am compared to him, because, you know, it's something very important...

I was quite disappointed to get only a 70%. So I took the test again with answers I would have put 10 years ago (Dungeon&Dragons, Linux, self build pcs! Give me points!). Cool 95%. I was really nerd ten years ago :-)

It's my birthday and I feel old...
