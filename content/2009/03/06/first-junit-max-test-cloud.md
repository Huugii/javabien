In [previous post]({{< relref "2009/02/25/junit-max-just-rocks.md" >}}), I talked about <a href="http://junitmax.com/junitmax/subscribe.html">JUnit Max</a> Eclipse plugin. Here's what latest version's test cloud view gives me:

Don't know what it's useful for yet but very promising.

By the way, beta testing is so cheap ($2 a month. In euros you cannot even buy a meal with the annual fee ;-)) that you should try too. The attention from Kent Beck towards his testers is very good.
