Today, Apple will announce version 3 of iPhone OS. Here is my personal wish list:

 + Horizontal keyboard for Mail and Sms
 + Preference to lock the homescreen icons so that my 2 years old son doesn't move/delete the icons. (BTW, an android-like unlock mecanism would keep him out of the homescreen)
 + Native Gmail application with search capabilities and push
 + Turn-by-turn GPS would be great
 + More transparent access to wifi would really be a revolution. Maybe the ball is on Orange's side, not on Apple's. (wonder if I could make money with a company called Banana ;-) )
