Some people started <a href="http://www.threeriversinstitute.org/blog/?p=87">attacks against a few TDD proponents</a>, namely Kent Beck and Bob Martin. This is not the first time and it won't be the last time. What these bloggers don't get is that TDD is not presented as the silver bullet by anybody serious about programming (and yes, Kent Beck and Bob Martin are serious about programming).

It's presented as a tool that developers can use if they are trying to improve their art of programming. There are plenty other paths to improvement.

To me, here is the main problem with TDD: it's too good of a tool. It's like a very good sharp knife, it does so many things well that you are tempted to use it for task. A good knife can cut, slice, dice, peel, dig, even screw and sometimes hammer with its handle. Some developers find TDD useful to help improve: test coverage, design, team work, code maintainability, ... We shouldn't forget the other tools in our toolbox. I know Kent Beck or Bob Martin don't.
