I've just started a Google Moderator on <a href="http://moderator.appspot.com/#15/e=43241&t=43242">Coding styles</a>. The idea is to find which coding style preferences are accepted by the majority, which interest nobody and which are balanced between likers and haters.
Google Moderator is not the perfect platform for this kind of experiment (no code formatting, no urls...) but I wanted to give it a try.

<strong>Feel free to add a lot more questions.</strong>
