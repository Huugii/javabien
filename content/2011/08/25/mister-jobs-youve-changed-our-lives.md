Today, Steve Jobs <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/24/us-apple-idUSTRE77N82K20110824">resigned</a> from Apple.

The first time, I heard about mister Jobs, I must have been about 12. My Dad brought a Mac home and opened the case to show me the names <a href="http://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/391">engraved inside</a>. I don't remember if I was astonished the most by the signatures having the look of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?um=1&hl=fr&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=xd5VTt6xNMjWsgbqvbHeCg&ved=0CDgQBSgA&q=han+solo+frozen+carbonite&spell=1&biw=1142&bih=863#um=1&hl=fr&tbm=isch&sa=1&q=han+solo+carbonite&pbx=1&oq=han+solo+carbonite&aq=f&aqi=g1&aql=&gs_sm=e&gs_upl=2892l2892l0l3187l1l1l0l0l0l0l229l229l2-1l1l0&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.&fp=a961ae119bf9ffc1&biw=1142&bih=863">Han Solo frozen in carbonite</a>, by the fact that only 5 screws had to be removed to open the case or by the sleek design of the <a href="http://www.google.fr/search?um=1&hl=fr&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=EN9VTrfpA4jssgaN3tCdCw&ved=0CDgQBSgA&q=mac+plus+motherboard&spell=1&biw=1142&bih=863">motherboard</a>. In fact the whole design of this computer was magic to a boy my age.

Then, there is the NeXT step. "Hey David, look what I just bought from the US" said my dad, staring at a 12'' <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=next%20cube&um=1&ie=UTF-8&tbm=isch&source=og&sa=N&hl=fr&tab=wi&biw=1142&bih=863">black cube</a> on the dining room table. Using this computer was like living in a dream. Can you imagine I used this amazing computer in 1989, one year before the Mac Plus was discontinued? That's crazy. There should at least be a century between the two. The urge to open the case I still remember! I think a single screw would keep the case closed. This <a href="http://web.me.com/bohearn/mg/nxtcube.html">beauty</a> you'd find inside. Anybody who's worked on a NeXT computer and later on a NeXTdimension as I did, knows there is a before and an after. Thank you mister Jobs. (Or maybe <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs#Beginnings_of_Apple_Computer">should I thank M. Sculley</a>)

At about the same time, Pixar, acquired by Steve Jobs, would release short animated movies like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxo_Jr">Luxo Jr</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knick_Knack">Knick Knack</a>, and you could try (wish? dream?) to do the same using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhotoRealistic_RenderMan">RenderMan</a> on a NeXT computer.

The third time Steve Jobs took a noticeable part in my life is just a few months after than when my best friend and I won a (near end of life) Mac Plus at Paris Apple Expo. We teamed up to answer a quiz about Apple. One of the answer, I still remember 20 years later, was "-D- Steve Jobs is vegetarian". Heck I didn't even really know what being vegetarian meant.

Since then, I've owned quite a few macs (one of which has even less than a single screw to open it. Guess which), watched even more keynotes, almost cried when I broke my first iPod, got mad when I first saw the iPhone, got goosebumps watching this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1R-jKKp3NA&feature=player_embedded">video</a>. Mister Jobs, you've changed our lives. You're not the only one, but you did. I wish you well.
