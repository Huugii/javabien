Yesterday, we learned how to create a pool a servers behind a load balancer, on Google Compute Engine.

I used a tool called <a href="http://www.cockos.com/licecap/">LICEcap</a> to capture the output of the console to an animated gif. It's nice seeing that everything is fully automated!

This tool is not suited for every screencast. For example, I found it hard to add annotations. Still, it's a very simple way of creating small tutorials.
