This year, for the third year in a row, <a href="http://www.code-story.net/blog/">Code-Story</a> will be at <a href="http://www.devoxx.fr/">Devoxx France</a>. This year we thought we wanted to present something different. We wanted to invite guests for smaller live-coding sessions.

How you start from a legacy java application and use Scala to first write tests and then improve the application.

Jean-Laurent and I will present

An opinionated full fledge web stack based on Java 8 and CoffeeScript.
