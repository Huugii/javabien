I'm a big fan of <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, so it's the first thing I tried on <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> text editor.

Well, it's really nice! It support <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown">Github Flavoured Markdown</a> which is nice when you write your documentation to be hosted on GitHub. It support a live preview while you type. No need to save. That's not something TextMate has out of the box.

And it works like a charm with <a href="http://www.coffeescriptlove.com/2013/02/literate-coffeescript.html">literate CoffeeScript</a>. Take a look by yourself:
