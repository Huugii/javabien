<a href="http://www.mix-it.fr/mixit14/sessions">Mix-IT 2014</a>'s agenda is out and YES! we've been selected with Jean-Laurent.

If you want to learn how to write modern webapps with Java 8, AngularJs and CoffeeScript, our <a href="http://www.mix-it.fr/session/388/application-web-moderne-en-java-the-codestory-way">workshop</a> is for you. Of course if you'd prefer not to develop webapps or would rather do it the slow way, there are other very good reasons to go to Mix-IT.

Here's my personal shortlist:

<blockquote>
  AngularJS from scratch (French)
</blockquote>

This <a href="http://www.mix-it.fr/session/424/angularjs-from-scratch">workshop</a>'s goal is to help you write the core of AngularJs. Why? So that you understand what's going on inside the black box. Nice thing to do if you fear AngularJs's supernatural powers. Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.

<blockquote>
  Introduction aux Google Glass (French)
</blockquote>

If you missed the second most voted talk at <a href="http://devoxx.be/#/">DevoxxBE</a> last November (one vote behind the first, because Alain forgot to vote for himself), go to Lyon right now and sit at the entrance of <a href="http://www.mix-it.fr/article/61/et-mixit14-aura-lieu-les-29-30-avril-2014-">CPE Lyon</a> with your tent. Why? Because everybody wants to see Alain gently stroke his Glasses with his fingertips. <a href="http://screen.yahoo.com/weekend-randall-meeks-000000711.html">OK Glass, Italian!</a>

<blockquote>
  boot2docker: zero to docker in 20s (English)
</blockquote>

Boot2docker is the way to go to support docker on every platform. OSX for example. The speaker, <a href="http://www.mix-it.fr/session/487/boot2docker-zero-to-docker-in-20s">Steeve Morin</a> is the creator of boot2docker plus he likes <a href="http://www.mix-it.fr/interest/Chatons">kitten</a>, <a href="http://www.mix-it.fr/interest/Beer">beer</a> and <a href="http://www.mix-it.fr/interest/Too%20much%20checkbox">too much checkboxes</a>. What else?

Mix-IT tickets are on sale on Monday. Google I/O 2013 sold out in 49 minutes. Apple's WWDC sold out under 2 minutes. <strong>I can't imagine how Mix-IT would NOT sell out in less than the <a href="http://www.iwantmyblinktagback.com/">blink</a> of an eye</strong>.
