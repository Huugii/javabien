Yesterday, Google announced <a href="http://googlecloudplatform.blogspot.fr/2014/03/google-cloud-platform-live-blending-iaas-and-paas-moores-law-for-the-cloud.html">great changes</a> on its Cloud Platform. One announcement I'd like to talk about is the new pricing model. I think it's a huge change.

One thing I'm always asked when I tell people I use the cloud is:

<blockquote>
  How can you afford it?
</blockquote>

Well, Google made a nice move to address this point. They lowered the price of Compute Engine by 32% and App Engine by 37.5%. That alone is very welcome. But the biggest move to my opinion is their <a href="https://developers.google.com/compute/pricing#sustained_use">Sustained-Use discounts</a>. The more you use a resource, the less it costs, per hour. Simple. Effective. Will remove a lot of headache.

<blockquote>
  That changes everything. Why?
</blockquote>

When you use VMs in the Cloud, you often have two options:

 + Pay upfront for a reserved instance/dedicated server. It will cost you less by the hour but you are locked in. You loss a lot of flexibility. This is not really what the Cloud was meant for. I've worked for a company that could offer buying and hosting 50 servers and had to keep on paying the bills when those servers where not used anymore. Not the best scenario.
 + Pay by the hour an higher price and spend a lot of energy trying to optimise your usage. That means man-hours, complex tooling...

<blockquote>
  Now, it's much simpler.
</blockquote>

You have one option: Use what you need and if it was used a lot, its price is lowered.

I like it when it's simple.
