I launched a small contest last week to [win a ticket]({{< relref "2014/03/18/win-your-ticket-for-mix-it-2014.md" >}}) for <a href="http://www.mix-it.fr/">Mix-IT</a> conference.

Not a lot of people participated. Obviously, it's hard to submit a Pull Request on a <a href="https://github.com/CodeStory/fluent-http">library</a> you've never seen before.

But we have a winner! <a href="https://github.com/mathieuancelin">Mathieu Ancelin</a> submitted two pull requests. One to <a href="https://github.com/CodeStory/fluent-http/pull/4">add basic CORS support</a> and one to support <a href="https://github.com/CodeStory/fluent-http/pull/2">Json manipulation API</a>

We also received a pull request from <a href="https://github.com/nhurel">nhurel</a> to fix the ordering of filters.

And before the contest, <a href="https://github.com/ybonnel">Yan Bonnel</a> submitted a <a href="https://github.com/CodeStory/code-story-http/pull/9">PR</a> to transform our stack into a standard servlet filter.

Nice work from all of you. I'll try to merge all the PRs before our [Modern Web with Java Tour]({{< relref "2014/03/21/modern-web-with-java-tour.md" >}}).
