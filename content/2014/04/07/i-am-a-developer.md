Last week-end, I was a little bored and wanted to create a website where French developers could say how proud they are to be developers. <a href="http://jesuisundeveloppeur.io/">Almost 600 people registered</a>.

That's a funny experiment for many reasons:

<blockquote>
  People are afraid of lists
</blockquote>

Lot's of people don't want to see their face on a list. Just because it's a list. I respect that and didn't expect such reaction. We blog, tweet, poke, like. The developer part of our life is not really private anymore. If I look at myself, the more I make public actions, the more I get in return.

<blockquote>
  Lot's of people are proud of being developers
</blockquote>

That's great. I also feel that some are proud and at the same time would like a better recognition. Developers want to be loved!

<blockquote>
  Developing the site was super easy
</blockquote>

Developing this kind of simple site is so trivial. No more heavy web framework with <a href="https://github.com/CodeStory/fluent-http">fluent-http</a>, easy deployment with <a href="https://cloud.google.com/products/compute-engine/">Google Compute Engine</a>, simple emails with <a href="http://elasticemail.com/">Elastic mail</a>. That's really nice. The slowest part of the process was DNS propagation!

At the end of the day, I feel really proud being a developer!
