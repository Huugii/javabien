You know I'm a huge fan of Java 8. It took a lot of time to be released but there's a handful of features that are worth the wait. This release is very important for the future of Java.

<blockquote>
  But what if Java 8 was so last month?

Not using Java 8 already? You should!
Not trying Java 9 already? You should!

People should have started using Java 8 months ago. Maybe not in production. At least for tests. I remember in November 2012, I was angry because the latest beta broke all my applications. I was angry but I was well prepared when Java finally shipped 18 months later.

You missed the Java 8 train. Don't worry, time has come to test Java 9!

<blockquote>
  Where's Java 9
</blockquote>

You can download <a href="https://jdk9.java.net/download/">here</a>. Give it a try.

  What's in it?

I don't know. Reading <a href="http://www.theserverside.com/news/2240205870/Forget-about-JavaOne-Lets-talk-about-the-feature-list-for-Java-9">this article</a>, it seems we might finally have <strong>Reification</strong> and <strong>Memory efficient data structures</strong>.

That'd be nice.

Give it a try. Now!
