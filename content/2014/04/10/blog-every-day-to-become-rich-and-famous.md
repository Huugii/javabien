I've been blogging every day for the past two months. When people ask me why I blog everyday, that's what I answer:

<blockquote>
  Because it helps me become rich and famous
</blockquote>

What else could it be? Passion? Wishing to connect with people? Forcing me to learn new things? You must be joking! All I want is to become rich and famous.

Now, I can feel that you, also, want to become rich and famous. You might even form into your head the image of you creating or reviving a blog. But where to start? Should you blog every day too? What kind of organisation should you put in place?

  I might be able to help you.
