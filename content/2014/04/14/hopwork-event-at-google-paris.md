You'd like to see what's new in <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud Platform</a>? Maybe you want to learn how to deploy a Java 8 application on App Engine when it's supposed to support only Java 7.

On April 28th at Google Paris, <a href="http://www.hopwork.com/">Hopwork</a> organises a Tech Event with <a href="https://plus.google.com/+GregDeMichillie/posts">Greg DeMichillie</a>, Google Cloud Platform Product Management, and myself, newly nominated <a href="https://developers.google.com/experts/">Google Developer Expert</a>.
