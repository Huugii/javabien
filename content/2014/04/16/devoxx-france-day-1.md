Today is the first day of <a href="http://www.devoxx.fr/">Devoxx France 2014</a>. Being part of the on-site team, I had a lot of things to do but not a single minute to post on this blog. However I talked to a lot of people who say they enjoy reading my posts every day. Not too long, not too short. Thank you, I do this for you. Hope you'll enjoy it as long as possible. If you have some feedback and you attend to Devoxx, please come talk to me. Otherwise, wait for another conference near you, or even simpler, drop a comment. I'm happy to get both positive and negative feedback.

Time to go to sleep. Tomorrow is yet another long day.
