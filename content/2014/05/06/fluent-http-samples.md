We are receiving more and more positive feedback on <a href="https://github.com/CodeStory/fluent-http">fluent-http</a>. It means more and more people need instructions to get started. Starting with fluent-http cannot be easier. It's one of the things we concentrate on. However a little help is always welcome.

So, we started to build a <a href="https://github.com/CodeStory/fluent-samples">list of samples</a> on GitHub. For now there's the classic <a href="https://github.com/CodeStory/fluent-helloworld">Hello World</a> and a sample <a href="https://github.com/CodeStory/fluent-angular">AngularJS application</a>.

We are going to add more and more samples that demonstrate things that can be done with <a href="https://github.com/CodeStory/fluent-http">fluent-http</a>.

Stay tuned and have fun!
