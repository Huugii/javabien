Yesterday, I published a couple of samples that demonstrate how to get started with <a href="https://github.com/CodeStory/fluent-http">fluent-http</a>.

Today, I added <a href="https://github.com/CodeStory/fluent-blog">another one</a> that shows how fluent-http can be used as a blog engine. We took a lot from <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> because Jekyll rocks!  Article can be written in markdown. Posts can share a layout. A dynamic archive section can link to all posts. Articles can be found by tags.

And, last but not least, you have all the power of real http stack. It's not just a static blog generator.

If all you want is a static site generator, Jekyll 2.0 was released a <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/news/2014/05/06/jekyll-turns-2-0-0/">couple of days ago</a>.
