Late 2012, I [announced on this blog]({{< relref "2012/11/05/bbl.md" >}}) I was available to speak about technical subjects during the lunch break. Companies would invite me, pay the lunch and I would make a presentation. I called this a <strong>BBL</strong>. Brown Bag Lunch.

<blockquote>
  Basically, I would "Speak for Food".
</blockquote>

Since then I animated more than twenty BBLs. And I had to turn down a lot of opportunities. Because, you know, I have a job!

<blockquote>
  That's great!

Something even more incredible is what <strong>Nathaniel Richand</strong> &amp; <strong>Fran√ßois Sarradin</strong> have done with this idea. They built a <a href="http://www.brownbaglunch.fr/">whole community</a> with 115 baggers as of today. Yes, <strong>115</strong>! That's incredible. And this is for France only.

If you want to build that kind of community in your country, and I think you should, contact these guys.

  Long live BBLs!
