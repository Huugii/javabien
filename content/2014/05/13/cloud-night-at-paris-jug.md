Next month, on June 10th, a special <a href="http://www.parisjug.org/xwiki/bin/view/Meeting/20140610">Cloud Night</a> will be held at Paris JUG.

I'll be talking shortly about Docker on Google Cloud Platform. I'll try to explain Docker the way I wish somebody explained it to me. Then I'll deploy a Java 8 application on Compute Engine with the help of Docker.

There will be time for Q&amp;As for I want to make sure <em>everybody</em> in the room understand what Docker means for the Cloud.
