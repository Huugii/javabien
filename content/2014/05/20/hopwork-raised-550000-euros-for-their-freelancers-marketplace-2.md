Greetings to my friends at <a href="https://www.hopwork.com">hopwork</a>. They announced they raised 550000 euros to carry on their effort on their marketplace that puts companies in contact with freelancers.

Companies should rely more on freelancers.

Freelancers should focus on delivering value to their customers, not spend their time on billing and searching new customers.

Hopwork makes it easy to reach these two goals. And they have plenty more ideas.
