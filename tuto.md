# Generate "Java Bien!" Blog

If you want to learn Hugo by modifying this blog's content,
it's actually very easy. All you have to do is:

## Step 1 - Run Hugo in server mode

Run the Hugo server with this command:

```bash
make server
```

From now on, it will monitor all the changes on the blog posts and regenerate
the whole site accordingly.

## Step 2 - Edit an article

Open the `walkthrough editor-spotlight devshell-web-editor-button "Code Editor"` `walkthrough orion-editor-icon`
and modify a markdown file (`*.md`) under the `content` folder.

## Step 3 - Open the web preview

Open `walkthrough spotlight-pointer devshell-web-preview-button "Web preview"` `walkthrough web-preview-icon` and choose `Preview on port 8080`.

Your updated post will be there!

## Step 4 - There's no Step 4
