# Generate "Java Bien!" Blog

If you want to learn Hugo by modifying this blog's content,
it's actually very easy. All you have to do is:

## Step 1 - Run Hugo in server mode

Run the Hugo server with this command:

```bash
make server
```

From now on, it will monitor all the changes on the blog posts and regenerate
the whole site accordingly.

## Step 2 - Edit an article

Open the <walkthrough-spotlight-pointer spotlightId="devshell-web-editor-button">Code Editor</walkthrough-editor-spotlight> <walkthrough-orion-editor-icon></walkthrough-orion-editor-icon>
and modify a markdown file (`*.md`) under the `content` folder.

## Step 3 - Open the web preview

Open <walkthrough-spotlight-pointer spotlightId="devshell-web-preview-button">Web preview</walkthrough-spotlight-pointer> <walkthrough-web-preview-icon></walkthrough-web-preview-icon> and choose `Preview on port 8080`.

Your updated post will be there!
